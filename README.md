This is a single page median income tool to help you compare the median income in two different zip codes. I envision this being useful for anyone in our program who is considering relocating for work after we complete the program. 

Because I was never able to find a free open source cost of living dataset, I've included three recent news articles for each zipcode. I think this gives the user a little flavor for each area.
