This will be a single page median income tool to help you compare the median income in two different zip codes. I envision this being useful for anyone in our program who is considering relocating for work after we complete the program. I'll add some styling that is relavent to the PerScholas students. I may add in some other search functionality as well. 

Cost of living data is hard to find. I'd ultimately love to include that here as well to help inform any decisions, but it may not be possible. I wonder if there's another metric I can use. Maybe the cost of gas in an area?

This data is all coming from the US census. There is a ton of data there. Finding the right pieces of data was a little challenging.
